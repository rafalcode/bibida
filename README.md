The name of this repository derives from the words "BIg BIoinformatics DAta", and its objective is to both record useful notes and tips as well to script and program some procedures which deals with especially data bionformatics directories and/or files.

## Initial orientation

The combined effect of higher speeds and lower prices in the sequencing of DNA has led to a many-fold increase in both the size and quantity of the files that are now habitually generated in bioformatics fields. Some of the most basic command-line tools that - certainly, in the case of Unix/linux - one uses when carrying out routine file handling quickly run into trouble when handling such large and numerous files. Example of such situatiosn are:

* entering a results directory and typing "ls" only to find that the system appears to hang because the directory has over a million files.
* attempting to open a large file with a text editor, only to find that it doesn't load precisely because the text editor tries to read it all into memory, and it's simply too big.

The upshot is that the everyday routine of file administration doesn't work with big bio data, and we need to change our approach.
